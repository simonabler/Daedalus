# Skill: Resume (Continue after restart)

## Goal
Resume the last run safely.

## Steps
1) Load last checkpoint/state (or todo.md if used)
2) Summarize what was done
3) Identify next todo item
4) Continue loop, respecting approval gates

## Rules
- If checkpoint missing or inconsistent → ask human
- Never assume unfinished steps are complete
